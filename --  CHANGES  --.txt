Audio:
- Blip rewrite  (handles high clocks and fixed-fraction math)
- Higher sampling rates  (much less lag, more crisp after frontend post-filtering) (96K, 192K, 368K, 768K)
- Kaiser low-pass filter  (more clear and fuller than blip, nearly same as raw) (20K cutoff, 40K transition, 60db stopband)
- Nuked OPLL fixes  (channel modulator wave leakage, ds1001 patch)
- Volume slider  (master = 0-100)


Video:
- 32-bit rendering  (more accurate colors)
- Gamma ramps  (linear, hardware, sgb (TV))


Compiler:
- MinGW build fixes  (ternary parsing)
- Speedup flags  (O3, LTO)
